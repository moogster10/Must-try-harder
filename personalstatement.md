Collaborate. Deliver. Reflect. Improve

## What tools, agile techniques and processes have you used in an multi-functional team to ensure everyone is involved and high-performing.

In my day to day work I use a range of tools and techniques to support collaboration, influence positively and deliver effectively.
  
### Tools that support involvement and discussion (Daily and weekly basis)
**Google analytics** - my go to tool for data to support conversations and decision making

**Miro** - co-creation workshop tool. Building presentation docs, managing collaborative workshops, journey mapping, persona building, 
quarterly missions. Always trying to be as visually engaging as possible.

**Hotjar** - User behaviour tool - especially video for monitoring user pain points.

**JIRA** - Ticket writing, problem framing, sprint building, roadmapping.

**Slack** - conversations and discussions</p>
 
### My agile techniques
Regardless of the specific framework, I always seek to connect with teams and individuals, communicate clearly and promote collaboration.

Techniques include
Building and clearly articulating scope, product vision, product goals and sprint goals

Leading sprint retros and reflection. Demoing products and outputs. Working together to improve and selling the vision and direction at all levels to multi-functional teams.
  
### Processes
Multiple processes to make sure the product improvement moves in the right direction.

Through the following I deliver and improve digital experiences.
  
- Robust discovery stages including competitor research, user research

- Clear and concise specification co-writing, from user stories and functional specifications.

- Goal setting and roadmapping - building roadmaps that relate directly back to strategic goals and KPIs

- Feedback and evaluation - bring teams together to understand the insights from customers and behaviours that can be acted upon
  
- Analytics and experiments - deducing as a team the way forward. Discussing experience and tests which can define the forward direction together.
