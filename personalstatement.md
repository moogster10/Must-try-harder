The CAR approach
Context - Explain the situation; what, where and when. Simply describe the challenge that you faced. Give the reader some background, just enough to set the scene.

Actions - Make sure that you explain how you did something not just what you did. What action or steps did you take? How did you do it? For some jobs, it might be quite detailed, but don’t talk about every single thing. Summarise as best as you can.

Results - What was the outcome? What results did you achieve? Talk about the results. Use numbers and percentages whenever possible. Remember if your result is not positive, describe what you have learnt.

```Collaborate. Deliver. Reflect. Improve```

## What tools, agile techniques and processes have you used in an multi-functional team to ensure everyone is involved and high-performing.

In my day to day work I use a range of tools and techniques to support collaboration, influence positively and deliver effectively.
  
### Tools that support involvement and discussion (Daily and weekly basis)
**Google analytics** - my go to tool for data to support conversations and decision making

**Miro** - co-creation workshop tool. Building presentation docs, managing collaborative workshops, journey mapping, persona building, 
quarterly missions. Always trying to be as visually engaging as possible.

**Hotjar** - User behaviour tool - especially video for monitoring user pain points.

**JIRA** - Ticket writing, problem framing, sprint building, roadmapping.

**Slack** - conversations and discussions</p>
 
### My agile techniques
Regardless of the specific framework, I always seek to connect with teams and individuals, communicate clearly and promote collaboration.

Techniques include
Building and clearly articulating scope, product vision, product goals and sprint goals

Leading sprint retros and reflection. Demoing products and outputs. Working together to improve and selling the vision and direction at all levels to multi-functional teams.
  
### Processes
Multiple processes to make sure the product improvement moves in the right direction.

Through the following I deliver and improve digital experiences.
  
- Robust discovery stages including competitor research, user research

- Clear and concise specification co-writing, from user stories and functional specifications.

- Goal setting and roadmapping - building roadmaps that relate directly back to strategic goals and KPIs

- Feedback and evaluation - bring teams together to understand the insights from customers and behaviours that can be acted upon
  
- Analytics and experiments - deducing as a team the way forward. Discussing experience and tests which can define the forward direction together.


### How you engaged a variety of stakeholders to agree on work you’ve been responsible for.

```- Conducted competitor analysis or market scanning, and created actions or recommendations
- Define a product or service vision
- Described how a product or service vision contributes to the wider business goals
- Created or updated a product strategy, including a value proposition (e.g. business model canvas)
- Created or updated a product roadmap, including outcomes and performance goals
- Identified and analysed stakeholders
- Created and communicated stakeholder comms
  - Represented or evangelised for my product or service outside of my department or organisation```

Research
```

I was tasked with analysing the orgainsations digital research offer with a view to rebuilding its digital presence. The challenge was to rebuild over 30 separate sub-sites which were being restructured under three virtual institutes with no real presence. The vision was to use digital to demonstrate a ‘viable, active and credible’ research establishment and community.

This vision and approach was to be presented to the Research Leadership Group which was the core research leadership team and represented over 15 key sectors and specialisms. In total I had around 20mins to deliver a vision for a piece of work that would take 18 months.

```Actions - Make sure that you explain how you did something not just what you did. What action or steps did you take? How did you do it? For some jobs, it might be quite detailed, but don’t talk about every single thing. Summarise as best as you can.
```
Created a vision deck to take stakeholders through - this included
Setting the scene through the of playback stakeholder insights from various interviews which had taken place. This was to address concerns and distill those concerns into a viable business proposition.

Analysis
I presented user behaviour on the current site pulling out key issues whihc aligned with their concerns. Including design analysis of how current design of their areas did not support current goals and examples of competitors and best practice. Comparitive review of centre sites architecture to show variation in approach but also opportunities to standardise the approach.


Vision and outcomes
- the ability to highlight the most influential information on pages
- ability to showcase the wider research network through multiple user access points


MVP scope to be scaled across sub-sites
- technically built to improve search performance (canonicals and metadata approach)
- ensure forward journeys from high value entrance page - profiles / projects / centres 
- consistency of content across areas
- apply improved navigation
- support training of staff to ensure local ownership
- a focus on accessibility

I presented a phased plan and roadmap including
- potential high level goals
- proposed measurement plan
- build priority order
- proposed communications topics and plans

Outcomes
The deck was agreed and a working group with designated staff to support delivery decision making was put in place. The project was delivered in 2021 with over 20 sites and 3000 pages rebuilt in optimised templates. The project delivery did slip and I would put this down to there being a high-lvel of consultancy which slowed delivery.


```Results - What was the outcome? What results did you achieve? Talk about the results. Use numbers and percentages whenever possible. Remember if your result is not positive, describe what you have learnt.

### Where you were able to create effective change and improve products or ways of working.


Discovery

It was identitified that the main booking interface for booking onto a university open day was on a legacy platform that needed to be removed. The booking interface required multiple levels of session types for the user to book plus relational sessions and personal itinary management. The interface was integrated with a non-documented legacy CRM system so this added another level of complexity. I decided to look at this as the legacy systems and design were non-supported yet open day attendance was the highest converter for new students.

Actions taken 
Used Google analyitics to analyse number of drop outs at specific stages focusing on mobile.
I analysed heatmaps and video to understand pain points and design issues on mobile.
Collated journey flows for the as-is journey.

Findings
1. The desktop version had to be used for mobile and this was causing the users to abandon in high rates during the multi-session booking stage.
2. The majority of bookings were through users who managed to book from a mobile.
3. Although the interface did support the majority of signups, the design and content would need to be adpated for a mobile orientated experience.
4. User interviews found the emailed itinery (PDF) essential for planning their day. 

Constraints
As the CRM was going out of support a decision was made to not support further development so any improvements would need to be made through the interface.

What happend next
I ran workshops with the team to map user flows and look for opportunities to improve. I created high fidelity wireframes to support buyin from stakeholders to undertake the work (as it was so important there was a retiscence to change). 
Worked with design team to create high-fidelity prototypes.
Created product goals and sprint plans to deliver over 10 weeks.
We created an extra step in the journey to serve the user an amendable itinery before confirmin attendence.
Set up alpha stage testing with users and business owners.
Worked with the team to create a measurement and monitoring plan for launch (fault monitoring, year on year conversion comparisons, traffic) which was used to engage with stakeholders post-launch

Outcomes
Against comparable activity mobile conversion almost doubled 20.3% > 38.84% and desktop rose around 10% 31% > 40.5%
Improved accessibility scoring (AA)
New product is being integrated as part of a new CRM project with further optimisation.

Context
One of the key products I have responsibility for is the recruitment of students area of the website. Part of the challenge was the reduction of the core area which had grown after constant use for around 5 years. This challenge required continual collaboration with multiple stakeholders to establish a new product in an existing strategy.

What I did
- Ensured there was a visible plan for stakeholders to monitor
- pdates on progress of workshops and discovery sessions
- Ensured all tasks were captured in JIRA 
- Created a sprint plan with phased milestones
- Established the key decision making group
- Communicated sprint progress and completed actions reports to stakeholder
- established standups with multi-functional team

Results
Successful delivery of new area including 
- Updated journey content
- New content page patterns established
- Navigation components developed, tested and delivered
- Measurement and monitoring plan agreed
