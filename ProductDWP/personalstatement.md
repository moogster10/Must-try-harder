I established the tools and techniques for my organisation’s first Digital Experience Team. Listed below are the ones I selected to support collaboration and to promote high performance
Tools:
Google analytics - to support conversations and decision making
Hotjar - viewing and commenting on user behaviour
Miro - co-creation workshop tool. Building presentations, facilitating collaborative workshops, journey mapping and persona building 
JIRA - task management, sprint building, road mapping
Figma - high-fidelity prototyping
 
Agile techniques

Ensuring team members are clear in which role they are fulfilling within the agile methodology
Building,  articulating and agreeing on the scope, product vision, product goals and sprint goals
Leading sprint retros and reflections.
Demoing products and outputs to build confidence
 
Processes to ensure involvement and high-performance
Discovery
Robust discovery workshops from journey mapping to task ranking and insight playback


Defintion
Co-writing - problem framing, user stories and functional specifications

Design
Group prototyping and testing as often as possible

Delivery
Goal setting and road mapping - building transparent roadmaps that relate directly back to strategic goals and KPIs

Optimisation
Feedback and evaluation - bring teams together to understand the insights from customers and behaviours that can be acted upon
Analytics and experiments - working together to define experiments and tests 
Monitor quality and performance and take remedial action



 
 
How you engaged a variety of stakeholders to agree on work you’ve been responsible for.



I was tasked by the Research Leadership Group with rebuilding their research digital presence. The direction received was to make it 'viable, active and credible’ and to present my vision, approach and plan back to the group (15-20 senior leaders) for approval prior to commencing the work. I presented a deck which

Established the challenges they faced and what good looked like
Used data to represent how users behave and showed how user goals can impact business goals
Highlighted the key tactical areas for improvement
Provided an overview of the benefits of the technical work (search etc)
Provided a direction of travel without promising specific outputs
Proposed the priority order of delivery and timings
Defined the communication and engagement plan
Developed a leadership working group to support ongoing decision making during delivery

The approach was agreed and the project was delivered with over 20 sites and 3000 pages rebuilt in optimised templates. 




Where you were able to create effective change and improve products or ways of working.

 
The open day booking digital service was identified as substandard and negatively impacting on recruitment, this was because:

The service did not work on mobile, was confusing and difficult to navigate
The interface was integrated with a non-documented legacy CRM system which could not be developed. 

The task was to improve this product to increase signup numbers within tight timescales and within the constraints of integrating with the existing CRM. Therefore I:

Created a multi-functional team to understand the opportunities and approach
Agreed on the targets and goals with stakeholders
Generated working prototypes to address ideas and engage with stakeholders
Instilled energy and enthusiasm even when hitting blockers in the project
Ensured there were opportunities to talk and test with users
Ensured the service was approved before launch with appropriate documentation, and technical staff trained to support the service on an ongoing basis

This resulted in, that against comparable activity mobile conversion almost doubled 20.3% > 38.84% and desktop rose around 10% 31% > 40.5% and an improved accessibility scoring (AA)



 
How you contributed to ensuring effective decisions are made and actioned to ensure delivery of work.

 
I have responsibility for the student recruitment area of the website, I identified that improvements were required and as such, I had to reestablish the standards and goals for the area with multiple stakeholders.
 
To do this I

Recorded and communicated decisions with stakeholders
Provided robust data to support decision making, aligning user research and the organisations strategic goals.
Communicated performance information once changes had been made to provide relevant information for future decisions to support continuous improvement
Established the key decision-making group ensuring members had the appropriate seniority and expertise required to direct delivery
Communicated sprint progress and completed actions reports to stakeholders
 
Decisions were made promptly which allowed for the work to be completed as planned and to quality standards. A phased approach was taken which allowed stakeholders to see continuous improvement and tools such as data studio dashboards were developed to capture information to support future decision making based on performance data.
